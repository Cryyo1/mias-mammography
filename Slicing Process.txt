1. List masks
2. For each mask:
    a. Get image name
    b. Open the full image
    c. Scale the image to half size
    d. Turn the image to an array
    e. Get the mask
        1. Open mask file
        2. Half the mask
        3. If mask has too much white in it trim the edges
        4. Does the shape of the mask match the image?
            i. No - try to resize the mask to match
            ii. If ratio isn't right skip
        5. Figure out borders of mask
        6. Is mask bigger than slice?
            i. No, return center of mask
            ii. Yes - return corners of mask with 10 pixel margin
    f. If the mask will fit into one slice create the slice from the center
    g. Else:
        1. Zoom the ROI out so it will fit into a slice
        2. Create corners of slice
        3. If the mask is too wide slice from each horizontal corners
        4. If mask is too high slice from each vertical corners
    h. If main slice goes over edges of image try to recenter it so it fits
        1. If slice is right size add to list
    i. If the mask is too small zoom in and add to the list
    j. For each slice if the dimensions are right add it to the list
